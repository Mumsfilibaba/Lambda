# Lambda
Lambda Game Engine

* Support Windows and macOS. 
* Focuses on abstracting D3D12 and Vulkan into a common API, based a lot on D3D11 and making Vulkan work similarly. For example, an immediate devicecontext similar to the one in D3D11. 
* Other features include a memory allocator for Vulkan device memory and the use of dynamic memory when mapping memory to the CPU.
